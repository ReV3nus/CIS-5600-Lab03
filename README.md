   * Edit your materials to allow for a 3rd color in your scene, such that you have highlights, midtones, shadows on your objects. Edit your shader so that the thresholds on these values are adjustable.
   * Shade the sonic and shadow receiving plane in "Lab Scene 2" to get a look similar to the one above!

   * Use one of the provided texture pngâ€™s in order to add a screenspace shadow pattern onto the shadows of the scene!
   * Hint 1: What does the "ShadowAttenuation" variable do?
  
Extra Credit:
 * Add some soft interpolation at the edges of your bands, for smooth transitions between color bands. Create a "smoothness" parameter that adjusts the degree of smoothness!
